# Changelog

All notable changes to the MiniLang compiler are documented here.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-24

- Added real Windows threads over a process-wide, thread-safe managed heap,
  per-thread stacks, cooperative stop-the-world GC and synchronization.
- Added 64 KiB thread-local allocation buffers for lock-free small-object
  allocation in threaded programs while preserving the single global heap.
- Fixed a rare high-CPU safepoint livelock under back-to-back collections by
  atomically republishing resumed workers as parked for the next GC request.
- Added thread arguments, logical thread IDs, status inspection, worker pools,
  locks, semaphores and thread-safe list, hash map and shared-value modules.
- Added `defer`, native FFI output parameters and project manifests with
  content-validated incremental builds.
- Added CPU feature detection, native byte-search primitives, CRC-32,
  hardware-dispatched CRC-32C and Windows CNG cryptography helpers.
- Improved generated-code optimization with known-struct method
  devirtualization/inlining, hot primitive XMM register homes and constant
  integer strength reduction; also improved global/object initialization and
  the memory-bounded self-hosted `.mlo` pipeline while preserving cross-compiler
  target-byte parity.
- Added guarded type-flow specialization for fallible `bytes(...)` results and
  16-byte user-function alignment. This restores compact byte-processing hot
  paths without weakening runtime errors and prevents local size wins from
  shifting later functions onto unstable instruction-cache boundaries.
- Replaced the self-hosted type-flow pass's repeated whole-function fixed-point
  scans with indexed facts and a dependency worklist, keeping compiler-sized
  source builds bounded while preserving emitted target bytes.
- Made package-qualified enum constants available to integer-flow analysis and
  replaced repeated self-hosted candidate-membership scans with indexed,
  monotone validation. This restores Python/self-host target parity without
  slowing large generated programs.
- Expanded cross-compiler, runtime, standard-library, fixed-point and large
  application regression coverage.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-22

- First stable, source-only release of the Python reference compiler and the
  self-hosted MiniLang compiler.
